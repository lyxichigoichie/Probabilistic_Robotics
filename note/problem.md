# problem unsolved

- in extended Kalman filter page 58, why it only expand variable $x_{t-1}$ and do not expand variable $u_t$. $g$ is function of $u_t$ and $x_{t-1}$
- In beam models of range finder page 157, how to realize that the measurement distribution can be mixed by a weighted average such a linear combination. In real world, it should be that addition of the four errors. why the addition of the errors caused the addition of probability of errors.
- In likelihood fields for range finders, why the probability of sensor measurements is modeled by zero-centered Gaussian not z_t^k centered.
- In landmark measurement page 178, whom the i-th feature is belong to??  Is the j-th landmark a feature of the map???  why corresponding the i-th feature to the j-th landmark not the j-th landmark???
